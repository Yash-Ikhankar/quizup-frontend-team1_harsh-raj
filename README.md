# QuizUp

![QuizUp Logo](./src/images/logo-gradient.svg)

Preparation for any exam is incomplete without mock tests and quizzes.
<br/>
That is why we will create a gamified platform for people who are preparing for various government exams/ IT exams.
<br/>
It will enable them to give mock tests and skill based quizzes in a fun and interactive way while gaining tips for areas of improvement.
<br/>
They will feel like playing a game while testing their skills.

# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
